        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Introduction: The Problem We're Solving</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">In today's data-driven world, the need for accurate, fast, and scalable search capabilities is more important than ever. Traditional search algorithms, relying solely on keyword-based methods, often fall short when dealing with the complexities of modern data structures, especially in AI and machine learning applications. Whether it's retrieving specific information from vast datasets or executing real-time searches, businesses struggle with balancing performance, accuracy, and scalability.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">The challenge lies in managing both structured data (such as relational databases and knowledge graphs) and unstructured data (like images, text, and vectors) while maintaining precision in results and handling the sheer volume of data that modern systems generate. In this context, Cosdata emerges as a game-changer by providing a robust, AI-powered platform that tackles these pain points.</p>
